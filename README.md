# DAX.LandLinkService
The DAX LandLink Service is a RESTful endpoint for processing LandXML.

Its primary purpose in live is to support Desktop and Web GIS clients importing and exporting LandXML, but also supports other formats and transferring between geodatabases.

Has until now been used by utilities - i.e. power grid and telco grid operators - optimizing their surveying and network documentation process.

A QGIS plugin exists that can work with the service. The service can also be used together with proprietary GIS solutions such as ArcGIS.
